# qatar_WC_2022_prediction
This project is a fun project to find out the FIFA 2022 Champion
We first collect data of all world cup playing team and then analysed their performance. Visualise them and understood the mean perfomance grouped by team is somehow poisson distribution. so in precting the result I used poisson module. Football is a discreate probability distribution of discreate goals which is event and having fixed time intervals. thus use poisson.
Here I have scrape the data from wikipedia by beautifulSoup but it misses some data in that case missing data is scraped by selenium. I thank online community for successfully complete this project.
